“How to Talk about Race” is a free 5-week program framework for learning how to moderate discussions about race. Though this material can be used by anyone, we designed it specifically to equip library employees with the skills to run effective and considerate book discussions, group conversations, and other programs about race in their communities.

Conversations about race are deeply personal and can be polarizing. The environment fostered in this learning circle should be one centered around compassion, understanding, dedication, and respect. In order to take full advantage of this experience, we ask all participants to:
- Dedicate yourself to participating fully by being present during meetings, working consciously through feelings of discomfort or bias, and creating opportunities for others to do the same.
- Make a commitment to learn from others by actively creating a space that is safe and respectful to all. It takes courage and vulnerability to share one’s lived experiences: when someone shares a story, believe them.

​

#### Course Description: 
​In order to talk about race, it is imperative to understand larger issues of race including:
- The extent that race impacts your daily life and your interactions in the systems surrounding us
- How implicit bias impacts our own perceptions of race
- Microaggressions
- How we frame things

In gaining a deeper understanding of moderating conversations relating to race, participants will learn how to:
- Establish ground rules for a group discussion
- Use and understand the purpose of an Identity Wheel
- Understand the concept & benefits of “lived experiences” and “framing and naming racism”
- Understand the fluid nature of verbiage relating to matters of race
- Navigate customer service scenarios relating to race
- Manage disruptive participants
- Utilize literature to drive community conversations about race
