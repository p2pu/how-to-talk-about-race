# About Us
If there is one thing you need to know about us, it is this: We owe so much of our confidence to approach conversations about race and racism to  Jody Grey (Director of the Office for Diversity & Inclusion at University of Minnesota) and Kristin LaHurd at the ALA Office of Diversity, Literacy, and Outreach Services.

We have also learned a lot (and want to pay thanks & homage to)  Ijeoma Uluo, Ibram X Kendi, Jay Smooth, and a variety of other amazing people who we consider to be Social Justice Warriors.

Hi, my name is Amrita S. Patel, and I'm an alumna from University of Central Florida with a bachelor's in Business Administration. I've worked for Charlotte Mecklenburg Library since 2005 and have been afforded a variety of opportunities that helped me to better understand aspects of social justice and racial equity. I have a passion for sharing what I know when it comes to serving special populations. I've developed training curricula on a variety subject matter, including the relevance and importance of sensory programs in libraries, the benefits of outreach programs and services, and more recently racial equity and inclusion. I also serve as the Board Chair for Disability Rights & Resources, a grass roots agency whose mission is "to create a fully inclusive community in which all people, with and without disabilities, may pursue their own goals and choices for living and working together."
