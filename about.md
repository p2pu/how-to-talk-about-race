# About Us
If there is one thing you need to know about us, it is this: We owe so much of our confidence to approach conversations about race and racism to  Jody Grey (Director of the Office for Diversity & Inclusion at University of Minnesota) and Kristin LaHurd at the ALA Office of Diversity, Literacy, and Outreach Services.

We have also learned a lot (and want to pay thanks & homage to)  Ijeoma Uluo, Ibram X Kendi, Jay Smooth, and a variety of other amazing people who we consider to be Social Justice Warriors.
