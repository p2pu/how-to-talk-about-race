# Read & Watch
_Suggested timing: 30 minutes_

We are surrounded by systems designed to systematically favor specific groups of people based upon their group identities. Watch the following videos to explore this topic.

**5min:** [What are structural, institutional and systemic racism?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtOOj5YvMyc&ab_channel=ABC7NewsBayArea)

**5min:** [Systemic Racism Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrHIQIO_bdQ&ab_channel=act.tv)

**5min:** [How Can We Win?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb9_qGOa9Go)

**15 min:** Group Reflections/questions about the final video:
*   How did the video make you feel?
*   Does the analogy of Monopoly help to better understand the various systems of oppression by which people of color, primarily black people of color, are affected by?
