_Suggested timing: 10 minutes_

**4 min:** Privately, think about how your privilege might have influenced your understanding of the world. How often do you think about your privileges? 

**6 min:** Publicly, share any reflections from todayâ€™s session: how does your privilege inform your ability to handle difficult conversations?
