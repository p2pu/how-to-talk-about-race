As we begin, let us consider the word “privilege”. We focus on privilege today and invite you to destigmatize this word, a term that can sometimes be negatively charged. When we use the word privilege, we want you to consider it as an advantage in life. Advantages we can take for granted and can sometimes be unaware of. Think about how your privilege might have influenced your understanding of the world.
