# Check-in
_Suggested timing: 10 minutes_

![privilege](/img/privilege.jpg)

As we begin, let us consider the word "privilege". We focus on privilege today and invite you to destigmatize this word, that can sometimes be negatively charged. When we use the word privilege, we want you to consider it as advantages in life. Advantages we can take for granted and can sometimes be unaware of. Think about how your privilege might have influenced your understanding of the world.

*   How do these advantages shape your ideas on racism, the healthcare system or even our justice system?
*   We invite you to ask yourself, “Who doesn't have the same opportunity or experience that I am enjoying right now?”
