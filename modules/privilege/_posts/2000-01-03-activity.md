# Activity
_Suggested timing: 40 minutes_

**15 min:** Individually watch the [Privilege Walk video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyl4EJhq47A) and do the [privilege walk activity](https://uh.edu/cdi/diversity_education/resources/_files/_activities/privilege-walk.pdf).

**25 min:** In breakouts, discuss the prompts in the course: 
*   When was the last time you had to think about your ethnicity, race, gender identity, ability level, religion, and/or sexual orientation?
*   What provoked you to think about it or acknowledge it?
*   Do you have privileges you have never considered before today?
