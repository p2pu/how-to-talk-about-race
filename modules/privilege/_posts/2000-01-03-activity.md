# Activity
_Suggested timing: 40 minutes_

**15 min:** View [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kfi3NKlQaU) as a group, then complete the <a href="../files/Color-Line-Exercise.pdf">Color Line exercise</a> individually. Ask participants the following:
* What part of this activity was difficult for you and why? 
* Have you considered these questions before?
* Many people react to this list by feeling guilty or shameful. Where do those feelings come from? How can we move beyond guilt/shame to responsibility and accountability? 


**25 min:** In breakouts, discuss the prompts in the course: 
* When was the last time you had to think about your ethnicity, race, gender identity, ability level, religion, and/or sexual orientation?
  * What provoked you to think about it or acknowledge it?
* Do you have privileges you have never considered before today?
