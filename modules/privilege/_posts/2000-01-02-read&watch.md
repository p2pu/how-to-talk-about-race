_Suggested timing: 30 minutes_

**10 min:** Skim through [10 Examples That Prove White Privilege Exists in Every Aspect Imaginable](https://www.yesmagazine.org/social-justice/2017/07/24/10-examples-that-prove-white-privilege-exists-in-every-aspect-imaginable/) individually; feel free to jump around and focus on the sections that are most interesting to you.

**20 min:** Thinking about how your privilege might have influenced your understanding of the world, share as a group:
*   How does your privilege shape your ideas on racism, the healthcare system or even our justice system?
*   Who doesn't have the same opportunity or experience that I am enjoying right now?
