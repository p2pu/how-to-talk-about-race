# Check-in
_Suggested timing: 15 minutes_

**5 min:** Establishing ground rules is necessary to create a safe, comfortable space. These are rules the group agrees to and the moderator enforces. Ground rules create parameters for conversations, especially intense conversations relating to race and racism. Review group expectations from a few agencies facilitating conversations about race:
*   [Catalyst – Conversation Ground Rules](https://www.catalyst.org/research/conversation-ground-rules/)
*   Iowa State University: [White Fragility Discussion Ground Rules​​](https://instr.iastate.libguides.com/c.php?g=869437&p=6240385)
*   [Ground Rules for Anti-Racism Discussions](https://www.mnys.org/assets/1/6/ground_rules_-_arc_discussion.pdf)
*   [Minnesota Dept of Health Ground Rules for Difficult Conversations and talking about race](https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/practice/healthymnpartnership/narratives/docs/GroundRulesDifficultConvos.pdf)

 

**10 min:** Revisit the ground rules and expectations from the first meeting. 
*   Would you advocate for anything else knowing what you know now?
*   Did you notice any similarities and/or differences between these various ground rules?
