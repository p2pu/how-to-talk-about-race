# Activity 
_Suggested timing: 35 minutes_ 

As we move towards modeling scenarios, remember that the purpose of these conversations is to encourage self-reflection, respectful exchanges, and develop communal understanding. It is not about changing people’s minds. 
*   Link discussion points to systems of racism & disproportionality
*   Acknowledge your privilege
*   Don’t expect a person of color to be your personal race resource
*   Respect confidentiality
*   Facilitate with another person
*   Own up to mistakes and do not focus on “fixing” everything

**10 min:** Review the three scenarios included below. Alternatively, use the scenarios as a basis to create your own based on experience that you’ve had at work.

**20 min:** Break out into small groups to work through the scenarios, alternating who facilitates each scenario.

**5 min:** Come back and review the reminders included above.  Anything you’d add now?

> Scenario 1: You have overheard a rumbling that one of your book club attendees is making others uncomfortable because he **continues** to state opinions on “All Lives Matter” not just “Black Lives Matter”.  They’re saying he gets upset if anyone doesn’t agree with his perspective. 

Prompt: What are some strategies to manage the discussion respectfully?

> Scenario 2: A group of book club attendees is in a heated discussion about immigration in the United States. At first, the conversation is simply a sharing of different opinions, but quickly deteriorates to sarcastic comments and ridiculing.

Prompt: Can you think of ways to bring the group together and move their conversation forward?

> Scenario 3: After work, you stop at the local grocery store wearing your library branded Black Lives Matter shirt.  You are immediately approached by a familiar library customer who says she is totally up in arms about the library featuring programs related to Black Lives Matter. The customer is threatening to pull her support of the library if she sees the library supporting the BLM Movement.

Prompt: How do you respond?
