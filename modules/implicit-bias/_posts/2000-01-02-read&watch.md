# Read & Watch
_Suggested timing: 30 minutes_

Watch both videos back to back, either individually or shared on a single screen.



*   3 min: [PBS POV Implicit Bias video](https://www.pbs.org/video/pov-implicit-bias-peanut-butter-jelly-and-racism/)
*   18 min: [The Dangers of a Single Story Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story)

Afterwards, spend up to 10 minutes discussing initial thoughts as a group. Some prompting questions to pull from:



*   Have you ever held a single story about another person or group of people?
*   Has anyone had a single story about you? If so, how did that make you feel?
*   How do our biases influence a conversation or a book club discussion?
*   What is the difference between implicit and explicit biases?
*   Are our biases malleable?
