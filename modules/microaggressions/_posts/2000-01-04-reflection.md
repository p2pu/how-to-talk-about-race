# Reflect
_Suggested timing: 15 minutes_

**5 min:** Personal reflection: Quietly reflect on something that Amrita and Denise write in the second week of the course: “Our lived experiences shape our life and build a frame of the world. If you consistently have negative experiences or experiences that make you feel different, how would that affect you? If you realize that people who look like you also have the same experiences, how would that affect you and what would that tell you about the world around you?”

**5 min:** Open space for group to share responses

**5 min:** Plus/delta


### For Next Week
When it comes to moderating discussions relating to race, it is inevitable that lived experiences – both good and bad – will come up in the conversation. The best way to approach these conversations is to frame the conversation and help drive a meaningful, productive narrative by tying in systems of disproportionality.

Our lived experiences shape our life and build a frame of the world. If you consistently have negative experiences or experiences that make you feel different, how would that affect you? If you realize that people who look like you also have the same experiences, how would that affect you and what would that tell you about the world around you?

In Week 3 of the Learning Circle, you will explore Systems of Disproportionality; these various systems will help you to frame conversations. Read and watch the following before the next meeting:
