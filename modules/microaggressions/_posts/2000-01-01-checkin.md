# Check-in
_Suggested timing: 10 minutes_

Say hi and share something that brought you joy since the last meeting.

If youâ€™d like, [take a breath](https://youtu.be/c1Ndym-IsQg) with this one minute guided breathing exercise, distinguishing between calming breaths (in through nose and out through mouth) and energizing breaths (in through mouth and out through nose). 

Come back to this breathing exercise whenever you want!
