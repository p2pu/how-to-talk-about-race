# Reflection
_Suggested timing: 15 minutes_

Use the remaining time for final group reflections:

> It is important to listen to the voices of people of color. White people cannot be doing all the talking – people of color need to be included in every space, and white people need to actually listen. What can you do to magnify the voices of the oppressed and marginalized?

### Independent Assignment

Review and practice what you learned in this module by completing the following:

* Read and watch the resources in ["Self-Care"](https://nmaahc.si.edu/learn/talking-about-race/topics/self-care) from the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture.
* Reflect by considering the answers to these questions from the page. You can also discuss with a friend or write the answers in a learning journal to keep track of your progress as you progress through the course:
  * When do you feel you are most mindful? When do you feel like you lose your presence?
  * Spend 2 minutes breathing and centering yourself by [doing nothing](http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/).
  * What are the critical conversations you’ve been avoiding that add stress to your life? What will you do to ground yourself before and during these conversations?
  * What are some positive affirmations you can tell yourself (in your head or out loud) throughout the day?
