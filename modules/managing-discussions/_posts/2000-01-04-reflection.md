# Reflection
_Suggested timing: 15 minutes_

Use the remaining time for final group reflections:

> It is important to listen to the voices of people of color. White people cannot be doing all the talking â€“ people of color need to be included in every space, and white people need to actually listen. What can you do to magnify the voices of the oppressed and marginalized?
