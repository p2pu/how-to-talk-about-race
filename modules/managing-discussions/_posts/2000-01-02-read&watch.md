# Read & Watch
_Suggested timing: 25 minutes_

As the facilitator it is your responsibility to maintain the space. Below are some concrete suggestions for supporting dialogue. 

**10 min:** Review the text below on your own
**15 min:** As a group, reflect on the list.
*   Have you seen these practices adapted in this learning circle?
*   What is particularly hard for you?
*   Any other suggestions that you would add to the list? Things you’d remove?


### Managing the Discussion
(Also known as **_“What do I do or say now?”_**)

**If someone interrupts:** Move on to the next speaker, encouraging orderly conversation.  Remember that people like to talk, and in many cases you will be able to move from one participant to another.

>“Thank you for your insights and sharing. Would anyone else like to share or have a comment?”

**To clarify a point someone has made:** Paraphrase what a person has said to clarify the point and move the conversation to a deeper place; you can do this in a way that makes it easy for the speaker to correct you.

>“What I’m hearing is ____________. Is that correct?”

**To dig deeper:**  Ask a probing or follow-up question to the speaker to get clarification. 

> “Let’s unpack that.”

> “Why is that important to you?”

>“Can you say more about that?”

**Engaging participants to respond to a comment that was made:** Ask a “reaction question” that invites other participants to comment on the last speaker’s comments in some way.

>“Does anyone else have a different view?”

**If the conversation gets “off track” or you need to redirect things:** Ask a new starting question. Go ahead and shift the conversation if you need to. You are a moderator.

>“In the interest of time we are going to move on.”

>“I’d like to bring us back on track now.”

**What if it gets quiet and nobody says anything?** Let there be silence.

>Often, facilitators feel pressure to keep the conversation flowing, so they are troubled by silence and try to fill it with a probing question or by changing the topic. It’s okay to sit in the silence and give people a little space to find their way to what they want to say.

**What if someone says something outrageously offensive?** It just might happen. Someone might say something that takes you aback – something that sucks all the air out of the space. Yep, it could happen.

>Let the comment sit. Check the reaction of the others in the space. Invite others to comment and respond.

**You can also ask for a few seconds of silent reflection and then go around the room and ask each person to share one word about how they feel.**
Remember, you aren’t here to fix anyone.
