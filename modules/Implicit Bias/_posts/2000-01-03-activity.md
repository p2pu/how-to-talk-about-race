# Activity
_Suggested timing: 40 minutes_

**25 min:** Individually, read through the University of Michigan article about [social identity wheels](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/inclusive-teaching/social-identity-wheel/) and watch the second half of the video, beginning at the 6:46 mark. (The goal for the meeting is not for everyone to complete their social identity wheel, but to get started enough to engage in a conversation about it).

When you’re finished, [begin working on your own social identity wheel](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/inclusive-teaching/wp-content/uploads/sites/732/2020/07/Social-Identity-WheelDefinitions.pdf).

**15 min:** In small groups (3-4) discuss the five questions in the middle of the wheel – each person should share only what they are comfortable sharing. Some additional questions for consideration:



*   Could the identity differences between me and the person I’m talking with about race be contributing to our differences of opinion or perspective?
*   Am I listening to people whose identities and experiences differ from mine?
*   Am I shifting some focus and power away from the most privileged in the conversation?
*   Am I providing a safe space for marginalized people to speak out?
