# Reflection
_Suggested timing: 5 minutes_

>Reflection time (also referred to as Plus/Deltas) is a great opportunity for the learners to provide feedback. Prompts such as “what went well today” and “share one thing that you would change about this session” can be clarifying for learners and the facilitator(s).

How did the first meeting go? Take a minute to share something that went well (a plus) and something that you’d like to change for next week (a delta). You can return to this list during the next meeting to ensure that you’re making changes that benefit the learning experience for everybody.


### For Next Week

Most learning circle meetings will not have any homework. However, this week there is a [5 minute Fusion video](https://fusion.tv/video/354460/how-microaggressions-are-like-mosquito-bites/) and a [~20 minute NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/08/872371063/microaggressions-are-a-big-deal-how-to-talk-them-out-and-when-to-walk-away) about microaggressions that you should review before the next meeting if possible.
