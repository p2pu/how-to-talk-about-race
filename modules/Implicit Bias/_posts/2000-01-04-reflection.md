# Reflection
_Suggested timing: 5 minutes_

How did the first meeting go? Take a minute to share something that went well (a plus) and something that you’d like to change for next week (a delta). You can return to this list during the next meeting to ensure that you’re making changes that benefit the learning experience for everybody.


### For Next Week

Most learning circle meetings will not have any homework. However, this week there is a [5 minute Fusion video](https://fusion.tv/video/354460/how-microaggressions-are-like-mosquito-bites/) and a [~20 minute NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2020/06/08/872371063/microaggressions-are-a-big-deal-how-to-talk-them-out-and-when-to-walk-away) about microaggressions that you should review before the next meeting if possible.
